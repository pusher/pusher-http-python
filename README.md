# Pusher HTTP Python Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pusher/pusher-http-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pusher/pusher-http-python)

The Python library for interacting with the Pusher HTTP API. This version, 1.x.x, is a major breaking change from versions <= 0.8. Version 0.8 can be found on the [0.8 branch](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-python/tree/0.8). Notes on the changes can be found [on this blog post](https://blog.pusher.com/announcing-version-1-0-0-of-the-python-library/)

This package lets you trigger events to your client and query the state of your Pusher channels. When used with a server, you can validate Pusher webhooks and authenticate private- or presence-channels.

In order to use this library, you need to have a free account on <http://pusher.com>. After registering, you will need the application credentials for your app.

## Features

* Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 support
* Adapters for various http libraries like requests, urlfetch, aiohttp and tornado.
* WebHook validation
* Signature generation for socket subscriptions

## Installation

You can install this module using your package management method or choice,
normally `easy_install` or `pip`. For example:

```bash
pip install pusher
```

Users on Python 2.x and older versions of pip may get a warning, due to pip compiling the optional `pusher.aiohttp` module, which uses Python 3 syntax. However, as `pusher.aiohttp` is not used by default, this does not affect the library's functionality. See [our Github issue](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-python/issues/52), as well as [this issue from Gunicorn](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/788) for more details.

## Getting started

The minimum configuration required to use the Pusher object are the three
constructor arguments which identify your Pusher app. You can find them by
going to "API Keys" on your app at <https://app.pusher.com>.

```python
from pusher import Pusher
pusher = Pusher(app_id=u'4', key=u'key', secret=u'secret', cluster=u'cluster')
```

You can then trigger events to channels. Channel and event names may only
contain alphanumeric characters, `-` and `_`:

```python
pusher.trigger(u'a_channel', u'an_event', {u'some': u'data'})
```

## Configuration

```python
from pusher import Pusher
pusher = Pusher(app_id, key, secret, cluster=u'cluster')
```

|Argument   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|app_id `String`  |**Required** <br> The Pusher application ID |
|key `String`     |**Required** <br> The Pusher application key |
|secret `String`  |**Required** <br> The Pusher application secret token |
|cluster `String` | **Default:`mt1`** <br> The pusher application cluster. Will be overwritten if `host` is set |
|host `String`    | **Default:`None`** <br> The host to connect to |
|port `int`       | **Default:`None`** <br>Which port to connect to |
|ssl `bool`       | **Default:`True`** <br> Use HTTPS |
|backend `Object` | an object that responds to the `send_request(request)` method. If none is provided, a `pusher.requests.RequestsBackend` instance is created. |
|json_encoder `Object` | **Default: `None`**<br> Custom JSON encoder. |
|json_decoder `Object` | **Default: `None`**<br> Custom JSON decoder.

The constructor will throw a `TypeError` if it is called with parameters that donâ€™t match the types listed above.

##### Example

```py
from pusher import Pusher
pusher = Pusher(app_id=u'4', key=u'key', secret=u'secret', ssl=True, cluster=u'cluster')
```

## Triggering Events

To trigger an event on one or more channels, use the `trigger` method on the `Pusher` object.

#### `Pusher::trigger`

|Argument   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|channels `String` or `Collection`   |**Required** <br> The name or list of names of the channel you wish to trigger events on   |
|event `String`| **Required** <br> The name of the event you wish to trigger. |
|data `JSONable data` | **Required** <br> The event's payload |
|socket_id `String` | **Default:`None`** <br> The socket_id of the connection you wish to exclude from receiving the event. You can read more [here](http://pusher.com/docs/duplicates). |

|Return Values   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|buffered_events `Dict`   | A parsed response that includes the event_id for each event published to a channel. See example.   |

`Pusher::trigger` will throw a `TypeError` if called with parameters of the wrong type; or a `ValueError` if called on more than 100 channels, with an event name longer than 200 characters, or with more than 10240 characters of data (post JSON serialisation).

##### Example

This call will trigger to `'a_channel'` and `'another_channel'`, and exclude the recipient with socket_id `"1234.12"`.

```python
pusher.trigger([u'a_channel', u'another_channel'], u'an_event', {u'some': u'data'}, "1234.12")
```

#### `Pusher::trigger_batch`

It's also possible to send distinct messages in batches to limit the overhead
of HTTP headers. There is a current limit of 10 events per batch on
our multi-tenant clusters.

|Argument   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|batch `Array` of `Dict`  |**Required** <br> A list of events to trigger   |

Events are a `Dict` with keys:

|Argument   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|channel `String`| **Required** <br> The name of the channel to publish to. |
|name `String`| **Required** <br> The name of the event you wish to trigger. |
|data `JSONable data` | **Required** <br> The event's payload |
|socket_id `String` | **Default:`None`** <br> The socket_id of the connection you wish to exclude from receiving the event. You can read more [here](http://pusher.com/docs/duplicates). |

|Return Values   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|`Dict`| An empty dict on success |

`Pusher::trigger_batch` will throw a `TypeError` if the data parameter is not JSONable.

##### Example

```python
pusher.trigger_batch([
  { u'channel': u'a_channel', u'name': u'an_event', u'data': {u'some': u'data'}, u'socket_id': '1234.12'},
  { u'channel': u'a_channel', u'name': u'an_event', u'data': {u'some': u'other data'}}
])
```

## Push Notifications (BETA)

Pusher now allows sending native notifications to iOS and Android devices. Check out the [documentation](https://pusher.com/docs/push_notifications) for information on how to set up push notifications on Android and iOS. There is no additional setup required to use it with this library. It works out of the box with the same Pusher instance. All you need are the same pusher credentials.

### Sending native pushes

The native notifications API is hosted at `nativepush-cluster1.pusher.com` and only accepts https requests.

You can send pushes by using the `notify` method, either globally or on the instance. The method takes two parameters:

- `interests`: An Array of strings which represents the interests your devices are subscribed to. These are akin to channels in the DDN with less of an ephemeral nature. Note that currently, you can only publish to, at most, _ten_ interests.
- `data`: The content of the notification represented by a Hash. You must supply either the `gcm` or `apns` key. For a detailed list of the acceptable keys, take a look at the [docs](https://pusher.com/docs/push_notifications#payload).

Example:

```python
data = {
  'apns': {
    'priority': 5,
    'aps': {
      'alert': {
        'body': 'tada'
      }
    }
  }
}

pusher.notify(["my-favourite-interest"], data)
```

### Errors

Push notification requests, once submitted to the service are executed asynchronously. To make reporting errors easier, you can supply a `webhook_url` field in the body of the request. This will be used by the service to send a webhook to the supplied URL if there are errors.

For example:

```python
data = {
  "apns": {
    "aps": {
      "alert": {
        "body": "hello"
      }
    }
  },
  'gcm': {
    'notification': {
      "title": "hello",
      "icon": "icon"
    }
  },
  "webhook_url": "http://yolo.com"
}
```

**NOTE:** This is currently a BETA feature and there might be minor bugs and issues. Changes to the API will be kept to a minimum, but changes are expected. If you come across any bugs or issues, please do get in touch via [support](support@pusher.com) or create an issue here.

## Querying Application State

### Getting Information For All Channels


#### `Pusher::channels_info`

|Argument   |Description |
|:-:|:-:|
|prefix_filter `String`  |**Default: `None`** <br> Filter the channels returned by their prefix   |
|attributes `Collection` | **Default: `[]`** <br> A collection of attributes which should be returned for each channel. If empty, an empty dictionary of attributes will be returned for each channel. <br> Available attributes: `"user_count"`.

|Return Values   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|channels `Dict`   | A parsed response from the HTTP API. See example.   |

`Pusher::channels_info` will throw a `TypeError` if `prefix_filter` is not a `String`.

##### Example

```python
channels = pusher.channels_info(u"presence-", [u'user_count'])

#=> {u'channels': {u'presence-chatroom': {u'user_count': 2}, u'presence-notifications': {u'user_count': 1}}}
```

### Getting Information For A Specific Channel

#### `Pusher::channel_info`

|Argument   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|channel `String`  |**Required** <br> The name of the channel you wish to query|
|attributes `Collection` | **Default: `[]`** <br> A collection of attributes to be returned for the channel. <br><br> Available attributes: <br> `"user_count"` : Number of *distinct* users currently subscribed. **Applicable only to presence channels**. <br> `"subscription_count"`: [BETA]: Number of *connections* currently subscribed to the channel. Please [contact us](http://support.pusher.com) to enable this feature.

|Return Values   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|channel `Dict`   |  A parsed response from the HTTP API. See example.  |

`Pusher::channel_info` will throw a `ValueError` if `channel` is not a valid channel.

##### Example

```python
channel = pusher.channel_info(u'presence-chatroom', [u"user_count"])
#=> {u'user_count': 42, u'occupied': True}
```

### Getting User Information For A Presence Channel

#### `Pusher::users_info`

|Argument   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|channel `String`   |**Required** <br> The name of the *presence* channel you wish to query   |

|Return Values   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|users `Dict`   | A parsed response from the HTTP API. See example.   |

`Pusher::users_info` will throw a `ValueError` if `channel` is not a valid channel.

##### Example

```python
pusher.users_info(u'presence-chatroom')
#=> {u'users': [{u'id': u'1035'}, {u'id': u'4821'}]}
```

## Authenticating Channel Subscription

#### `Pusher::authenticate`

In order for users to subscribe to a private- or presence-channel, they must be authenticated by your server.

The client will make a POST request to an endpoint (either "/pusher/auth" or any which you specify) with a body consisting of the channel's name and socket_id.

Using your `Pusher` instance, with which you initialized `Pusher`, you can generate an authentication signature. Having responded to the request with this signature, the subscription will be authenticated.

|Argument   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|channel `String`   |**Required**<br> The name of the channel, sent to you in the POST request    |
|socket_id `String` | **Required**<br> The channel's socket_id, also sent to you in the POST request |
|custom_data `Dict` |**Required for presence channels** <br> This will be a dictionary containing the data you want associated with a member of a presence channel. A `"user_id"` key is *required*, and you can optionally pass in a `"user_info"` key. See the example below.  |

|Return Values   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|response `Dict`   | A dictionary to send as a response to the authentication request.|

`Pusher::authenticate` will throw a `ValueError` if the `channel` or `socket_id` that itâ€™s called with are invalid.

##### Example

###### Private Channels

```python
auth = pusher.authenticate(

  channel=u"private-channel",

  socket_id=u"1234.12"
)
# return `auth` as a response
```

###### Presence Channels

```python
auth = pusher.authenticate(

  channel=u"presence-channel",

  socket_id=u"1234.12",

  custom_data={
    u'user_id': u'1',
    u'user_info': {
      u'twitter': '@pusher'
    }
  }
)
# return `auth` as a response
```

## Receiving Webhooks

If you have webhooks set up to POST a payload to a specified endpoint, you may wish to validate that these are actually from Pusher. The `Pusher` object achieves this by checking the authentication signature in the request body using your application credentials.

#### `Pusher::validate_webhook`

|Argument   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|key `String`   | **Required**<br>Pass in the value sent in the request headers under the key "X-PUSHER-KEY". The method will check this matches your app key.   |
|signature `String` | **Required**<br>This is the value in the request headers under the key "X-PUSHER-SIGNATURE". The method will verify that this is the result of signing the request body against your app secret.  |
|body `String` | **Required**<br>The JSON string of the request body received. |

|Return Values   |Description   |
|:-:|:-:|
|body_data `Dict`   | If validation was successful, the return value will be the parsed payload. Otherwise, it will be `None`.   |

`Pusher::validate_webhook` will raise a `TypeError` if it is called with any parameters of the wrong type.

##### Example

```python
webhook = pusher.validate_webhook(

  key="key_sent_in_header",

  signature="signature_sent_in_header",

  body="{ \"time_ms\": 1327078148132  \"events\": [ { \"name\": \"event_name\", \"some\": \"data\" }  ]}"
)

print webhook["events"]
```

## Request Library Configuration

Users can configure the library to use different backends to send calls to our API. The HTTP libraries we support are:

* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) (`pusher.requests.RequestsBackend`). This is used by default.
* [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) (`pusher.tornado.TornadoBackend`).
* [AsyncIO](http://asyncio.org/) (`pusher.aiohttp.AsyncIOBackend`).
* [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch/) (`pusher.gae.GAEBackend`).

Upon initializing a Pusher instance, pass in any of these options to the `backend` keyword argument.

### Google App Engine

GAE users are advised to use the `pusher.gae.GAEBackend` backend to ensure compatability.
